# belly-button-challenge

## Overview
This project features an interactive dashboard using belly button biodiversity data from [this source](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json). The data can be viewed in 3 different visualizations.

### Bar Chart
The bar chart is a quick glance at the top 10 OTUs present in the selected subject.  Visitors are able to hover over each bar to view the corresponding OTU label  This was achieved through filtering, slicing, and reversing the order of the data.

### Bubble Chart
The bubble chart helps to visualize all of the OTUs present in the selected subject.  The size of the bubble correlates to the number of samples present in the subject.  The color of each bubble is connected to an OTU ID.  Hovering over each bubble reveals the label for the OTU.

### Gauge Chart
The gauge chart tracks the weekly belly button washing frequency for the selected subject.  I attempted to get a needle to point to the value from each subject, but ultimately left it as you see after hours of fidgeting with it. It's a battle for another day!
